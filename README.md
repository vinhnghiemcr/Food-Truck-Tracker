### Description
Tracks the food trucks around the user. Updated the current location of all food trucks in certain areas. It also recommends for food truck lovers or tourists the most popular ones. It also helps food truck owners update their current location and advertise themselves with their best food. 

### App Evaluation

* Category: Social media app / Food
* Mobile: This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however, the mobile version could potentially have more features.
* Story: Tracking the location of food trucks around the user’s location. The food trucks can update their current location to advertise themselves. The user can track their favorite food truck's whereabouts through the app, and discover new/ popular food trucks.
* Market: Any individual could choose to use this app, especially food lovers. The truck owners also use the app to update their current location and food items to its customer. The potential user could be the street sellers who are constantly on the move.
* Habit: This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted to depending on how often they go eat or look up food trucks.
* Scope: First we would focus on people who love food trucks and the food truck owners.  Then perhaps this could evolve into a food sharing application as it expends not only to a food truck but small sellers who don’t have a fixed location.
